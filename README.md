# Pacman ISN 
## _A little 3D pacman version for a school project_
Sadly this project is not fully finished. But here is the start of a little 3D version of Pacman made for Web, using: NodeJs/Express.js server (a little Backend for Frontend, just serving static files), HTML, CSS, JS, Electron.JS, and Three.js. 
Hope you like it ðŸ˜Š, even tho it is still in development. 
Started while I was at LycÃ©e Pasteur Vergueiro - SÃ£o Paulo, SP - Brazil


## Development stages... :
* [x] Game base, with: Three.js, Pacman movements, and map generation
* [ ] Ghosts and their algorithms
* [ ] Little fruits and ghosts collision handling
* [ ] Some more advanced graphics (like some lighting and little bit higher 3D models)
* [ ] Better optimize web version with some options in React
* [x] Desktop support using Electron.js (under development, branch: ```using-electron```)
#### _Maybe... :_
* [ ] Making a second version with mobile support using React Native
